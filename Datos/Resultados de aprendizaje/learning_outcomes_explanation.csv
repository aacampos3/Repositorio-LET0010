Level 3,"Percentage of young (age 16-24) adults scoring equal to or higher than 341 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. At this level, tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications. Some navigation across pages and applications is required to solve the problem. The use of tools (e.g. a sort function) is required to make progress towards the solution. The task may involve multiple steps and operators. The goal of the problem may have to be defined by the respondent, and the criteria to be met may or may not be explicit. There are typically high monitoring demands. Unexpected outcomes and impasses are likely to occur. The task may require evaluating the relevance and reliability of information in order to discard distractors. Integration and inferential reasoning may be needed to a large extent. The target population was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-24 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status.
