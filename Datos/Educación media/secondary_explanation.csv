UIS.ADMI.ENDOFLOWERSEC.MAT,Administration of a nationally-representative learning assessment at the end of lower secondary education in mathematics (number),"This indicator evaluates whether a national or cross-national assessment of learning outcomes was conducted in the last 5 years in (a) reading, writing or language and (b) mathematics at the relevant stages of education. The indicator is expressed as a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for each subject area and each stage of education. The implementation of a learning assessment in the reference period serves as an educational vital tool to assess progress. 'Yes’ values indicate that the country is monitoring learning outcomes regularly at the given stage of education and in the given subject areas. This will enable the country to review and adapt as necessary its national policies on education and learning to ensure that all children and young people have the opportunity to acquire basic skills at each education level and in each subject area.

Children attending pre-primary or non-formal education are considered out of school. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) releases estimates of out-of-school children calculated from both administrative and household survey sources (Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys). Administrative records and household surveys are two data sources which differ in fundamental ways: who collects the data, as well as how, when and for what purpose.
